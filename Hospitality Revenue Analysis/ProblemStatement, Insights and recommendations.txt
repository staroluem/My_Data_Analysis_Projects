Problem Statement:

Domain:  Hospitality       Function: Revenue

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its 
market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands 
wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have 
an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Insights and recommendations that I have taken for increasing hotel revenue are as given below:

1. There are 3 types of pricing strategies - flat strategy, weekend/weekday strategy and dynamic strategy. 
   Hotels is following flat pricing strategy due to which rooms pricing is same across all aspects. hence no increment in revenue.

2. Its been observed that if there is lower ratings their is lower occupancy % which leads to more cancellation%.
   Hotels should focus on customer ratings and service they are providing.
   
3. Booking were less from online websites as compared to direct offline. 
   If they give promotions instead of lowering the prices there revenue may increase.
   for example, 5% off on three night stay.

4. If pricing increases, Occupancy decreases for this company must follow "Pareto Principle"
   also known as "2080 rule" which means select bottom performing hotels make them problem statement and 
   after solving them your business goes up. Hence needed measures must be taken to uphill the revenue.
